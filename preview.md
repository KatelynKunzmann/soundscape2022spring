## Psychedelic Trip with Phipps
In this preview I am showing the beginnings of snippets that will be used at various portions in my soundscape. Only 2 audio files here will end up together as they are now and that is _in phipps_ and _forget_. _In phipps_ is a snippet from Tipper's Ambient Set and _forget_ is from Psychedelic Ghosts and Goblins. So far, I have located some psychedelic ambient sounds and music to accompany the background for the psychedelic trip. Tipper is a musical artist known for their extraordinary psychedelic music. I decided to use one of Tipper's songs from SoundCloud. I have broken up the 10 minute song into parts and labelled them as things they remind me of or as where their place will be in the overall soundscape. All in the 10 minute song, I found some psychedelic nature sounds, trippy vibes as background music to be layered over by my own recordings later on, and an ending portion that will wrap up the soundscape. I have also recorded the sound of a cap falling and applied some effects to make it sound loopy. I am not sure where it will fit in yet if at all. I used fade, amplify, and speed change effects today. 
The _Funky Nature_ music sounds perfect for a walk through botanical gardens while tripping which will most likely accompany part of the come down portion. _Ice_ really reminded me of a silent winter trip which would be perfect for the outdoors part of Phipps. The _bg music_ is there in case I want to use any of it for the future. 

Questions:
    What if a track does not list what license it has? Do I assume it is not allowed to be used? _Tipper - Ambient Set_ from SoundCloud does not have a license listed so I might have to source something else if this is true.

Also for the future, here are my next steps:

* Go to Phipps with fully charged phone and headphones
* Record an entire walk through the Conservatory including outdoors
* Sounds to aim for:
    * People conversing in the background
        * Edit these to make them sound trippy as trip progresses
    * Water dripping
        * Edit this to make it sound trippy as trip progresses
    * Water flowing if possible
    * Birds
        * Edit to make echo effects
    * Me talking and making comments
        * Loose narration on transitions of the trip
